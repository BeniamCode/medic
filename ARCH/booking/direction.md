“Add Slot” is the doctor’s primary tool for defining their recurring weekly availability. Clicking it should open a modal (or side panel) where the doctor selects one or more days (Mon–Sun) and toggles each day Available / Not available. If a day is set to not available, its inputs are disabled/greyed out. For available days, the doctor sets a time range (e.g., 09:00–17:00) and a slot pattern (e.g., every 15/30/60 minutes), and the system automatically generates the implied slots for that day. Include an inline preview (e.g., “Will create 16 slots”) and allow adding multiple windows per day (split shifts like 09:00–12:00 and 17:00–20:00).

The form should also include the booking context the slots apply to: appointment type/service (optional “All services”), location (and optionally room), and consultation mode (in-person/video/phone), plus optional breaks (e.g., lunch 13:00–14:00) and buffers if you support them. On save, the backend must validate no invalid ranges (end > start), and prevent creating availability windows that conflict with existing rules; it should then persist a recurring schedule rule (not one-off exceptions) so the “Weekly Hours” table updates immediately. Time-off blocking stays separate in the “Time Off” section and should override these recurring slots automatically.
